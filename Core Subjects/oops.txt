 -- In OOPs, the property of enclosing data and its related functions into a single entity(in C++ we call them classes) is called encapsulation.


 -- Structure members are public by default whereas, class members are private by default. Both of them can have private and public members.

 -- Polymorphism is the concept of allowing a user to override functions either by changing the types or number of parameters passed.

 int func(float)
 int func(int , int , char)


 -- C++ does not allow a derived class pointer to point a base class pointer whereas Base class can point to a derived class object. Both base class and derived class can have pointer objects.

 -- There are two types of polymorphism in C++ namely run-time and compile-time polymorphisms.
1)  Run-time polymorphism is implemented using Inheritance and virtual in which object decides which function to call.
2) Compile-time polymorphism is implemented using templates


-- Pointer object initialization of a class using new involves constructor call whereas using malloc does not involve constructor call



New vs malloc
i) new is an operator whereas malloc is a function
ii) new calls constructor malloc does not
iii) new returns required pointer whereas malloc returns void pointer and needs to be typecast
