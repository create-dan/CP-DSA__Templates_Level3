// https: // leetcode.com/problems/minimum-consecutive-cards-to-pick-up/description/

// You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the value of the ith card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value

// Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards.If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.

// Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
