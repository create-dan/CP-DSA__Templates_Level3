Heap - Complet Binary tree
Max-Heap and Min-Heap

Time Complexity of Insertion , Deletion - O(logn)


- 1 based indexing 
leftIndex = 2*i
rightIndex = 2*i + 1

- 0 based indexing
leftIndex = 2*i + 1
rightIndex = 2*i + 2

Heapify Algo
- ( n/2 + 1 ) to n --> Leaf Node (Heap in itself)
- Place node at correct position


Heap Sort
- Build Heap 
- Swap first with last and size--

Priority_Queue


Max_heap --> priority_queue<int> pq;  
Min_heap --> priority_queue<int, vector<int> , greater<int>> pq;
